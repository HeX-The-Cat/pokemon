# Quicksearch Pokemon Project

Project for quick info search about pokemons, aimed to be used on phones.  
Meant to give basic information of the pokemon searched without having to go wiki diving.

# Known problem(s)

Search Bar does a little yoga while searching.  
Some newest pokemons have no Ability description, this is problem with API not having the info  
As I am a potat, I've used main as just as sort of "save online" point instead of dev branch, lesson learned and will fix this Soon™  
Plans are a complete rewrite with stuff I've learned (like cleaning up that pesky var)
