# Quicksearch Pokemon Project

Project for quick basic info search for pokemons, aimed to be used on phones (altho not yet really usable on them), mainly for personal use.
Wanted to create easy app to use for getting the basic, relevant info regarding pokemons while playing the games.

# Known problem(s)

Regional forms not working.

Actual webpage of the project is dead, figuring out a fix, problem for tomorrow's HeX.

# Working local version

# Fully broken online version
