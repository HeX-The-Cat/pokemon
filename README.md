# Quicksearch Pokemon Project

Project for quick basic info search for pokemons, aimed for phones, mainly for personal use
Wanted to create easy app to use for getting the basic, relevant info regarding pokemons while playing the games.

# Known problems

Some searches cause app to semi-crash (e.g. Weezing), possibly traced error to problem with missing key in JSON fetches.
In these cases you need to reload the page as each error search leaves permanent loading icon on the page and new searches appear under this icon.

# How to use

npm install -> npm run dev
