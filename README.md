# Quicksearch Pokemon Project

Project for quick info search about pokemons, aimed to be used on phones.  
Meant to give basic information of the pokemon searched without having to go wiki diving.

# Known problem(s)

Search Bar does a little yoga while searching.  
Spinner not loading on first page load  
Some newest pokemons have no Ability description, this is problem with API not having the info
