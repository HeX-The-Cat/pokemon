<p>Api request failed.</p>
<p>This is most likely due to typo or incorrect way to request data for pokemon</p>
<p>If you wanted to look for different forms of pokemon, try following:</p>
<p>Mega Evolutions: try e.g. "Metagross Mega" or "Charizard Mega X".</p>
<p>Pokemons with forms: try e.g. "Shaymin Land" or "Aegislash Shield".</p>
<p>Still figuring out regional variants, please stand by for update.</p>
